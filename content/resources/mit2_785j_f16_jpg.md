  caption: "The figure shows 1) effects that mechanical forces can have on cells (a,\
    \ b; chondrocytes), and 2) the generation of mechanical force by nonmuscle cells\
    \ (c, d; chondrocytes).\_\n\n- a. A chondrocyte in articular cartilage viewed\
    \ by transmission electron microscopy, with its endoplasmic reticulum shown as\
    \ s in the inset (scale bars, 3\u03BCm for a and b, and 400nm for the insets).\_\
    \n- b. A 50% compression of the cartilage sample results in a change in cell shape\
    \ and compaction of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, responsible for the synthesis\
    \ of extracellular matrix molecules. Alterations in the organelle can change the\
    \ structure of the matrix molecules that the cell synthesizes. \\[Szafranski et\
    \ al, *Osteoarthr & Cart.* 12:937 (2004)\\]\_\n- c and d. Light microscopy images\
    \ of chondrocytes, which other studies have shown express \u03B1-smooth muscle\
    \ actin, seeded into a porous collagen-glycosaminoglycan scaffold, followed over\
    \ a 5-hr period (scale bar, 50 \u03BCm for c and d). (c) For up to 40 min, the\
    \ 2 chondrocytes on the horizontal strut have a rounded phenotype. (d) After 5\
    \ hrs, the cells spread on the strut and buckle it as a result of their contraction.\
    \ The 40% shortening of the strut (from 144 \u03BCm in c to 89 \u03BCm in d) causes\
    \ bending of the members to which it is attached, and contracture of the sponge-like\
    \ scaffold. \\[Zaleskas et al, *Biomat.* 25:1299 (2004)\\]\_\n\n(Figures a and\
    \ b by Jon D. Szafranskiy, et al. and Figures c and d by Janice M. Zaleskas, et\
